# Exam
This is our exam project.

The results of the project can be seen from running examproject.ipynb. Defined functions can be seen in the py-files q1.py, q1_alt.py, q2.py and q3.py. Each numbered pyfile refers to problem 1, 2 and 3.

Dependencies: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project does not require any further installations
