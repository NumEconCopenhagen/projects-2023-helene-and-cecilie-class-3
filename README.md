This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project examning the time use of a household consisting of a male and a female. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **The worlds bank data bank** and **our world in data** on life expantancy, child mortality and income across countries and show a positive relationship between life expentancy and income. We show that this is partly explained by child mortality in poor countries. 
3. Model project. We solve the solow model with human capital numerically using a Cobb-Douglas function. We extent the model with a CES function. 
4. Exam. Our answer to the exam questions.
