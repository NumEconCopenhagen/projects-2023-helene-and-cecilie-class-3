Our project is titled **The Preston Curve: Examining the relationship between income and life expectancy** and is about the positive relationship between life expectancy and income. We focus on why Africa has lower life expectancy than other parts of the world.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:
